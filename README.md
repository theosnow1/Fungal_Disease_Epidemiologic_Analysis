# Fungal_Disease_Epidemiologic_Analysis
Self-contained epidemiologic analysis pipeline in a single RMarkdown file, including population-weighting, regression modeling, spatial clustering (LISA), and stratified incidence visualization. This is not meant as a reproducible pipeline, as the data leveraged for this project contains PHI. This is a record of work.
